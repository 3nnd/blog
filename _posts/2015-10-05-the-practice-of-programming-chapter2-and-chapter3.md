## Chapter2

* if you are developing programs in a field that's new to you, you must find out
what is already known, lest you waste your time doing poorly what others have
already done well.

* if repeated searches are going to be made in some data set, it will be 
profitable to sort once and then use binary search.

## Chapter3

* whoever opens an input file should do the corresponding close: 
matching tasks should be done at the same level or place.

* as a principle, library routines should not just die when an error
occursl error status should be returned to the caller for appropriate
action.

* do the same thing the same way everywhere. keep consistency.

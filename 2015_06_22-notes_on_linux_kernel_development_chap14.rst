Block I/O
=========

-  | The difference (between character device and block device) comes
     down to
   | whether the device accesses data randomly --- in otherwords,
     whether the
   | device can seek to one position from another.

-  | The block is an abstraction of the filesystem --- filesystems can
     be
   | accessed only in multiples of a block.Although the physical device
     is
   | addressable at the sector level, the kernel performs all disk
     operations in
   | terms of blocks.

-  | the kernel (as with hardware and the sector) needs the block to be
     a power
   | of two.The kernel also requires that a block be no larger than the
     page size.

-  | The purpose of a buffer head is to describe this mapping between
     the
   | on-disk block and the physical in-memory buffer (which is a
     sequence of bytes
   | on a specific page).

-  | the kernel does not issue block I/O requests to the disk in the
     order they
   | are received or as soon as they are received.

-  | Both the process scheduler and the I/O scheduler virtualize a
     resource
   | among multiple objects.

-  I/O schedulers perform two primary actions to minimize seeks: merging
   and sorting. a) Merging is the coalescing of two or more requests
   into one.
   Consequently, merging requests reduces overhead and minimizes seeks.

| b) The entire request queue is kept sorted, sectorwise, so that all
  seeking
| activity along the queue moves (as much as possible) sequentially over
  the
| sectors of the hard disk.This is similar to the algorithm employed in
| elevators ------ try to move gracefully in a single direction.

    #. Linus Elevator: The Linus Elevator I/O scheduler performs both
       front and
       back merging.
    #. The Deadline I/O scheduler: ensure that write requests do not
       starve
       read requests.
    #. The Anticipatory I/O scheduler aims to continue to provide
       excellent
       read latency, but also provide excellent global throughput.
    #. The Complete Fair Queuing (CFQ) I/O scheduler is an I/O scheduler
       designed for specialized workloads, but that in practice actually
       provides
       good performance across multiple workloads.It is now the default
       I/O scheduler
       in Linux(2.6).
    #. the Noop I/O Scheduler truly is a noop, merely maintaining the
       request queue in near-FIFO order, from which the block device
       driver can pluck
       requests.
